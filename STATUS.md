# Current Status of Project

Next Steps:
1. Setup form for item creation in item_create.html
2. Setup itemCreate in app.py to receive POST request and add item to database

Remaining Steps:
- Set up python logic from creating, updating, and deleting items
- Protect creation, updating, and deletion of items with authorization. Any user should be able to create a new item, but only the creator of existing items should be able to update and delete them.
- Add code to item_create, item_update, and item_delete templates.
- Style
- Add any necessary supporting javascript.
- Comment code.
- Bring up to pep8 (pycodestyle) and pep257 standards.
