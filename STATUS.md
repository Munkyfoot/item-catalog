# Current Status of Project

Remaining Steps:
- Set up python logic from creating, updating, and deleting items
- Protect creation, updating, and deletion of items with authorization. Any user should be able to create a new item, but only the creator of existing items should be able to update and delete them.
- Add code to item_create, item_update, and item_delete templates.
- When 'not logged in' error is called. Store attempted url in session so you can be redirected after logging in.
- Find repeating blocks of code and consolidate to keep things DRY.
- Style
- Add any necessary supporting javascript.
- Comment code.
- Bring up to pep8 (pycodestyle) and pep257 standards.
